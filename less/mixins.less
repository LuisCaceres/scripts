/* Passes a mathematical expression into a calc() function. This expression evaluates
to a value between @min and @max. The value is generated at runtime and it depends
on the width of the viewport. For example, consider a screen width between 320 
and 1200 pixels and a minimum and maximum desired values of 1 and 100 pixels. At 
320 pixels wide the value resulting from the expression is 1 pixel. At 1200 pixels 
wide the value is 100px. Any intermediate screen width results in a value between 
1px and 100px. */
