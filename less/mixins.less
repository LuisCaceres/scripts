/* Passes a mathematical expression into a calc() function. This expression evaluates
to a value between @value1 and @value2. The value is generated at runtime and it depends
on the width of the viewport. For example, consider a screen width between 320 
and 1200 pixels and a minimum and maximum desired values of 1 and 100 pixels. At 
320 pixels wide the value resulting from the expression is 1 pixel. At 1200 pixels 
wide the value is 100px. Any intermediate screen width results in a value between 
1px and 100px. Please note that @value2 does not have to be greater than @value1. */

    /* 320px is assumed to be lowest value for the width of the viewport whereas 
    1200px is the largest. */
    @limits: calc( @value1 ~" + " unit(@value2 - @value1) ~" * ((100vw - " 320px ~") /" unit(1200px - 320px) ~")" );

// NOTE: Percentage values do not seem to work. For example,
// .minmax(20%, 100%)
// yields unexpected results.
